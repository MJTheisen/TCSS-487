# TCSS-487
A repository for all the code from Cryptography class with Professor Paulo Barreto.

This code was done for a programming project I worked on with Trevor Tomlin. 
He deserves most of the credit! 

Included is Keccak512, KMACXOF256, SHAKE256, cSHAKE356, Ed448GoldilocksPoint

I plan on going through and starting over from scratch at some point, as well as adding in CRYSTALS: Kyber.
